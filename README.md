# python-challenge
The two projects in this repository were built to satisfy the requirements of Rutger’s Data Science Bootcamp, Module 3 Challenge.  
  

## **Project #1 – PyBank - Folder contents:**  
1. analysis (folder)
   o	output.txt – to output results  
3. Resources (folder)  
  o	budget_data.csv  
    -	Column A – Date  
    -	Column B – Profit/Loss  

4. main.py  
  o	 Goal: Using "budget_data.csv", create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the               following values:  
    -	The total number of months included in the dataset  
    -	The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period  
    -	The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes  
    -	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period  
    -	The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period  
  

  
## **Project #2 - PyPoll - Folder contents:**  
1. analysis (folder)  
  o	output.txt – to output results  
  
2. Resources (folder)  
  o	election_data.csv  
    -	Column A – Voter ID  
    -	Column B – County  
    -	Column C – Candidate   
      
3. main.py  
  o	Goal: To create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:  
    -	The total number of votes cast  
    -	A complete list of candidates who received votes  
    -	The percentage of votes each candidate won  
    -	The total number of votes each candidate won
